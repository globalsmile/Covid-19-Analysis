# Project NAME: Covid-19-Global Report

---
# Project Objective: 
COVID-19 (The coronavirus disease), a communicable respiratory disease broke in 2019 and has spread to the far ends of the world infecting humans, both young and old. Different countries implemented lockdowns in order to contain the disease and to prevent further spreading while finding medical solution to cure the infected. Over days,months, years and still counting, there are reports of people confirmed to be infected and dead as a result of the outbreak. Accolades to the medical practitioners who have made recovery mostly possible. However, there are data of these reports of cases, deaths and recovery which are available on daily basis. While aspiring to be a data analyst, I have been able to learn to analyse these data- kudos to NG30dayoflearning. This analysis is just to provide an insight into the data provided for different countries.
